# Manual fixing of ID's and removals in BoxBeadsART 2020 participants.
## Based on missing data, missing ID's and computer ID and timestamps. Err on the side of losing data rather than "overmatching".

# Spelling errors in ID.
## HL07EN21 swapped HL in BeadsTask
## ON05NS23 omitted 23 in ART
## EN06IR08 misslabeled ER06IR08 in BoxTask
## EN04IR22 noncapetilized EN04ir22 in BoxTask
## en08ar12 misslabeled as en09ar12 in BeadsTask
## kanhil labeled kanhil_misforstod in BoxTask
## STERIG decapitalized as sterig in ART

# Missing ID's matched by timestamps, sequence, and computer ID.
## 1 (Box) is EN3HN11
## *blank* (Beads) is en05ar27 - Fixed during extraction

# Clearly test-runs by experimenters based on time-stamps and/or names.
