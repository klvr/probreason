## Tiny bit of caution
<div class="notes">
The following single character keyboard shortcuts enable alternate display modes:

- 'f': enable fullscreen mode
- 'w': toggle widescreen mode
- 'o': enable overview mode
- 'h': enable code highlight mode
- 'p': show presenter notes
- 'esc': exits all modes.
</div>

*"Never start a presentation by excusing yourself"*
- Everybody

*However:*

- "fdsfdsfds" is probably a test/pilot-participant
- Speed > Robustness
- Only a select few variables
- Simple tests
  - No attention to prereg
  - No deep-dive
- Only small amounts of theory referenced

## Sample
