#Data-cleaning Effort-task
#Manually removed the fdsfdsfds-participant file, as this created a lot of trouble
#In the script, ghgj, htr645 and 56yg are removed as well. Important to leave those files in(!) however the
#solution I've gone for is not very good, as any additional data would destroy this.
#In the future incomplete data should be removed in the script, and not manually, but works _for now_.
