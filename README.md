# Probabilistic Reasoning

R-scripts for the Probabilistic Reasoning project

Separate R-scripts for extracting data from each task

Raw and clean data only uploaded to OSF (GDPR)

All scripts should be run in it's entirety, will automatically fetch missing packages, and will output a cleaned CSV-file

To-do:
- File directory, choose either 2018-way or 2020-way
- Master script for running sub-scripts
- "Leftover" files must be put back / work out of the box (check)
- Use time-stamps to check for sequence for 2020

Minor To-do:
- Jan 2020 Presentation Rmd broken by changes to scripts?
