# Probabilistic reasoning & information sampling

R-scripts for data extraction, cleaning and analysis.

Raw and clean data only uploaded to OSF (GDPR).

Download the data, clone this repository, run the "MasterScript-DataExtractionMerging.R"-script, to extract, clean and merge all data, or use the "Loading-files.R"-script and choose task-wise script(s) for the task(s) you want data from.
To run the analysis-script, the script above must run first, unless you use the collected clean-data.csv file.

The following tasks are included:
- ART: Ambiguity and risk avoidance task (Levy et al.).
  - Data from 2018 and 2020.
- Beads Tasks:
  - BeadsOnejar: Beads drawing task (computerized version of the Philips and Edwards task).
    - Data from 2018.
  - BeadsTone: Beads drawing task, auditory version.
    - Data from 2018.
  - BeadsTwojar: Beads drawing task, two jar version (Huq et al.).
    - Data from 2018 and 2020.
      - Minor difference in two trials.
- Box Tasks:
  - BoxIrreg: Box opening task with disorganized placement of the boxes, no limit, two colours, ratio provided. Free sequences.
    - Data from 2018.
  - BoxNorm: Box opening task, with grid placement of the boxes, no limit, two colours, ratio provided. Free sequences.
    - Data from 2018.
  - BoxNew: Box opening task, with grid placement of the boxes, both no limit and limit trials, multiple colours, no ratio provided. Fixed sequences.
    - Data from 2020.

The following questionnaires are included:
- CAPE: Community assesment of psychotic traits.
  - Data from 2018 and 2020.
- AQ: Autism Spectrum Quotient (Baron-Cohen et al. 2006).
  - Data from 2020.
- FiveD: Five dimensional curiosity questionnaire.
  - Data from 2020.
- NfCC: Need for (cognitive) closure questionnaire.
  - Data from 2020

(Local) File-structure:
- All R-scripts in wd.
- Raw data/: Folder subfolders with raw-data.
- Intermidiate data/: Data saved before further use (e.g., ART long-format for hBayesDM, and hBayesDM outputs).
- Cleaned data/: CSV-files with extracted and cleaned data, both task-wise and collected.
- Obsolete scripts/: Scripts no longer in use, but might contain useful sniippets.
- Tasks and other files/: The tasks and questionnaires, as well as other non-data related files from OSF.
- Presentation Jan. 2020/: Brief task-presentation from Jan. 2020.

To-do:
- Merging.
- Sequences of tasks.
  - Use time-stamps to check for sequence for 2020?
- Experimenter logging.
  - 0XX -> Lu
  - 1XX -> Wib
  - 3XX -> Leo
- Exclusion according to prereg criteria, and flagging.
- Ideal Baysian Observer.
- Analysis.

_Could_ be improved / collected:
- ART-hBayes: Run cra_exp once more (more inits), make sure both ambig and risk is set at 0 or 1.
- BeadsOne: Extract decisions from log-files.
- BeadsTone: Extract decisions from log-files.
- BeadsTwo: Extract decisions from log-files (2018-data), and from CSV-files (2020-data).
- BoxIrreg: Recode answers, recode sequences.
- BoxLog: Seperate answers and sequences, recode answers, recode sequences.
- BoxXlsx: Recode choice.
- Cape: IRT / FA on the items.
- Overall: Turn all trials in all tasks the same way. Remove the small left-over _manual_ fixes in order to accomodate for any new data.
- Other: Fetch NFCC, AQ and FiveD.
- Debrief feedback.

Other notes:
- Variance in ambig and risk attitude estimations.
- Quantify degree of correct probability estimation during Box-task.
- 2021: Box-task mix free and v2020. With ART and Dice.
- Wrong choice after plenty of draws - Flagging (Beads and Box tasks).
- Extreme probability without decision (Box2020) - Flagging.
- Box-limit: Encountered "time-out", effect on next trial(s).
- Different decision-tactics/inference heuristics as models. E.g., streaks.
- ART questionnaire.
- Fr√©chet distance.
